Importing 24-bit PCX files works now with the new PCX reader from
	  Russell Marks (public domain).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Importing PPM images with more than 256 colors failed because it was
	  first converted to 24-bit PCX, which <i>xfig</i> couldn't read before now.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Importing TIFF files (which is first converted to PPM them to PCX)
	  works now with new PCX reader to handle 24-bit images.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Bug where updating an arrowhead used the line thickness from the
	  current settings instead of the line being updated to set the
	  arrowhead thickness.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
"=" instead of "==" in checking if picture type is XBM to allow

<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
<i>xfig</i> would stop reading objects from a file when it encountered one
	  bad object unless it had already read one or more good objects
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If a polygon was created with ALL coincident points (i.e. zero width/
	  height, <i>xfig</i> would remove ALL points when reading the file and would
	  subsequently crash.  Objects with zero width/height are now removed
	  when reading the file.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If a box with fewer than four points or a polygon with fewer than
	  three points is read from a file, <i>xfig</i> removes it
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Could still move point of object even if its depth was not active
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
References to "make" in Imakefile changed to "$(MAKE)"
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When vertex number display was turned on, canvas wasn't refreshed to
	  show them

<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Background color of RGB slider lock buttons changed to random color
	  when lock turned off
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
User colors in current figure would be lost if user previewed more
	  than one file before cancelling file popup
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
"Transparent" color menu button for GIF export wasn't updated after
	  export panel was created when loading new figure
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Spurious comments would appear in spline after editing control point
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If editing spline point for curvature and spline line had zero
	  thickness, the spline would dissappear during edit
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Incorrect declaration for put_msg()
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Prepended $(DESTDIR) to $(XFIGLIBDIR) directory variable in Imakefile
	  to be portable
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Changed w_menuentryP.h and w_menuentry.c to explicitely use
	  X11/Xaw3d/...  path for menu entry when user has XAW3D set in
	  Imakefile to use 3D Athena Widget set
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
<i>xfig</i> now uses gunzip instead of uncompress to uncompress .Z files to
	  be more portable for Cygwin environment
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Current directory for loading/saving figures was overwritten when
	  changing export or picture browse directory
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Loading a .fig file or importing a picture from an MSDOS filesystem
	  failed because <i>xfig</i> tried to see if the file existed with a suffix of
	  .Z, .gz, or .z, all of which were reported by stat() to exist because
	  it apparently truncates any suffixes after the first
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Bounding box of objects in negative region weren't calculated
	  correctly when positioning grid was on
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If "allow negative coordinates" was turned off, one could still pan
	  into negative region by dragging mouse on side ruler with middle
	  button pressed
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Bug which prevented dragging rulers (with middle mouse button) into
	  negative region unless it had been moved into the positive region first

One of the header values for TIFF files was incorrect (was "DD", should be "II")
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When scaling a box and the point positioning grid is more coarse than
	  the points in the box, and you try to grab a corner of the box, <i>xfig</i>
	  thought you want to scale either horizontally or vertically only.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png">
