<h1><a name="newfeatures">New Features in <i>xfig 3.2.3</i></a></h1> 
(Released Jan 14, 2000)

<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Arrow thickness is a function of line width by default now instead of
	  absolute
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If figure is modified and user does "File/New", <i>xfig</i> first asks if
	  user wants to save the file before doing the "new" operation
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Changed the "paste text" key in app-defaults file from F20 to F12,
	  because most systems don't have an F20 key.  The "Paste" key on Sun
	  workstations (it is really F18) may also be used to paste text.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Changed default export border margin width to 0
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Re-enabled export magnification for EPS
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New "Flags" group of library objects from Roland Rosenfeld.  These are
	  flags of Europe which Roland converted from a Sketch example.
	  There is also Japan's and the U.S.'s flag which were drawn in <i>xfig</i> by
	  Brian Smith
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Added Ian MacPhedran's web site http://duke.usask.ca/~macphed/soft/fig/
	  for FIG-related information to the html docs under "Related
	  Applications" in the "Getting and Installing Xfig" section
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Moved allocation of <i>xfig's</i> 32 "standard" colors last in the widget
	  setup procedure so that there is a better chance of the widgets
	  getting the correct colors before the colormap fills up and <i>xfig</i>
	  changes to a private map.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Assumes default of Letter(or A4 if metric mode) if no %%BoundingBox in
	  imported eps
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
All traces of GIF decoding/encoding have removed from <i>xfig</i> so as to
	  avoid the patent royalty issue with Unisys corp.  <i>xfig</i> now calls
	  giftopnm (part of the netpbm package) to read the GIF file and then
	  ppmtopcx to convert it to a colormapped image that <i>xfig's</i> read_pcx
	  routine can handle.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Mr. T. Sato's email address has changed to VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp as
	  of July 15, 1998. He is the person to whom you should send email if
	  you have any questions about the Japanese HTML pages.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New depth manager.  Enable/disable depths individually or all at once
	  to selectively hide parts of drawing.  Can also click on one depth
	  button and drag mouse up or down to enable/disable multiple buttons.
	  Command-line options -showdepthmanager and -hidedepthmanager to
	  control it (resource Fig.showdepthmanager). The default is to show it.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When updating the depth of a compound object, the relative depths of
	  the objects inside are retained, with the object having the smallest
	  depth number being assigned to the value updated by the user.  For
	  example, if you update a compound object to depth = 5, and it contains
	  objects with depths 8 and 11, after the update they will have depths
	  5 and 8 respectively. From T. Sato.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Default depth for creating new objects is now 50 to make it easier to
	  put new objects on top without having to remember to start the older
	  objects at a depth > 0.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Xfig allows panning to negative x and y now. This is the default
	  and may be turned and off with the -allow_neg command-line option
	  and from the global settings panel.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Command panel has pull-down menus for File, Edit, View and Help
	  operations.  Default accelerators for these menus are Meta-F, Meta-E,
	  Meta-V and Meta-H respectively.
	  File menu includes list of recently loaded Fig files.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Comments in Fig files are preserved with the objects and are written
	  back when the file is saved.  Popup edit for objects allows entering/
	  editing of comments.  Also, clicking mouse button 2 on the canvas in
	  edit mode will popup a panel to edit comments for whole figure.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
From the File/Open panel, you may startup another <i>xfig</i> process to open
	  a Fig file.  From T. Sato.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New join/split button to split a line/spline/etc into two, or to join
	  two lines/splines etc together to make one.  Also, will convert a box
	  to a line by splitting between two corners, and close an open line
	  or spline by joining the two ends.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Arrow keys, Home and End keys may be used to browse any of the lists
	  in <i>xfig</i>. (e.g. Open file list, library popup object list, misspelled
	  word list in spell checker)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Border option put back in for exporting to EPS and bitmap formats
	  (fig2dev -b option).
	  User may specify border margin in pixels (roughly).  This will be
	  a background margin area around the figure bounding area.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New background color option for printing and exporting - sets whole
	  background of figure to this color.  Available for all bitmap formats
	  and PostScript, EPS, PSTEX and PDF
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New background option to specify background color for figure.  This
	  works for all bitmap formats and PostScript (including pstex).
	  This is passed to fig2dev as the -g option.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If your system uses /etc/printcap to define printers, <i>xfig</i> will make
	  a pulldown menu for the printer selection in the printer panel.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New "smooth" button in export to smooth when exporting to bitmap
	  format (e.g. GIF, JPEG).  Causes fig2dev (using -S 2 option) to force
	  ghostscript to render at 2x magnification which improves font
	  rendering, then passes through pnmscale to reduce to original size,
	  which also smooths the image by averaging colors of adjacent pixels.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Export/Print errors now appear in the popup error message window
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Popup object editor positions itself adjacent to object being edited
	  instead of possibly being on top of it
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Xfig automatically chooses pwidth, pheight and the number of buttons
	  per row on the mode panel (left side) if necessary, to fit on a small
	  screen.  If the user explicitely chooses any of those options, their
	  choice overrides the automatic setting.
	  From T. Sato (VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New PDF export driver (uses ps2pdf from the ghostscript distribution)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New CGM export driver (Computer Graphics Metafile) for fig2dev (and in
	  <i>xfig</i> export menu)
	  from Philippe Bekaert (Philippe.Bekaert@cs.kuleuven.ac.be)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
More paper sizes (Japanese JIS B0-B10 and ISO A0-A9)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Middle button in paste mode will place object at its original position
	  (where it was when it was placed in the <i>xfig</i> cut file)
"Spinners" increment/decrement by value appropriate to item being
	  modified.  E.g., fill intensity % now steps by 5% for each click
	  of the mouse on the spinner arrows, and text step by 0.1.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Also, if mouse button is held down on spinup/down button, spinner
	  counts automatically after "spinner_delay" every "spinner_rate"
	  milliseconds (resources).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Fill intensity and Pattern fill now show image in popup edit panel
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Can now draw arcs by defining:
		1. Center point
		2. First angle/Radius
		3. Second point to deterimine direction
		4. Final angle
	    Initiate this mode by starting arc with mouse button 2. Original
	    arc mode still available.  From T. Sato (VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New color scheme (grayish instead of bisque) - can still use old
	  colors by using Fig-color.bisque.ad or really old colors in
	  Fig-color.classic.ad
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
I have made the web pages available from our server at:
	      http://www-epb.lbl.gov/xfig
	  A mirror site in Japan is
	      http://www.lint.ne.jp/~masashi/xfig/index.html
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Popup window with global settings (use Meta-g or Alt-g) containing:
	checkbutton for tracking mouse in rulers
	checkbutton for showing page borders
	checkbutton for showing info balloons
	checkbutton for lengths on lines
	checkbutton for showing vertex numbers on objects
	entry for max image colors
	entry for image editor
	entry for spelling checker
	entry for HTML browser
	entry for PDF viewer
	checkbutton for turning on/off debug information
	     Consequently, the balloon on/off checkbutton has been removed from
	     the message window area
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Two new "make" options:
<ol>
<li>
	   "make install.doc" - install only the documentation files (i.e.
	      man pages, html and pdf files)
<li>
	   "make install.libs" - install only <i>xfig</i> object libraries
</ol>
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Filename mask for File and Export panels can have multiple wildcard
	  masks separated by blanks or tabs, e.g. "*.fig *.fig.gz *.fig.[Zz]"
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Export wildcard mask is dynamically changed when selecting the export
	  language (e.g. *.gif when GIF is selected for export).  Thus, the
	  Fig*export_panel*mask*string resource is defunct.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New format for browser resource will parse for "%f" and replace with
	  the filename.  Using this and the -remote option for netscape, <i>xfig</i>
	  will either use a running netscape to open the help file (html) or
	  will start one if one isn't already running.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
PDF viewer resource is also parsed for %f (filename)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Xfig will first try the correct PostScript font name (e.g. AvantGarde)
	  and then try a backup font name if the first fails.  If that one fails
	  too, it will use 6x13.  In the past, because the AvantGarde, Bookman,
	  HelveticaNarrow and Palatino fonts were NOT distributed with the X
	  distribution from the Open Group (and the X Consortium before that),
	  <i>xfig</i> would substitute fonts for those, that were close.  Now it will
	  try the correct one and switch to one of the backups if it doesn't
	  exist.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
FIGAPPS file updated with new information about GNU plotutils
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Rulers shows fewer ticks for smaller zooms
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Rulers show more labels between major ticks for larger zooms
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New floppy disk library object in "Computers"
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New firewall symbol and "generic hardware" library objects in "Networks"
	  from Tomi Ollila (Tomi.Ollila@tfi.net)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New "Optics" library includes mirrors, lenses, fiber optics
	  from Kai-Martin Knaak (kmk@abraxas.physik.uni-mainz.de)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New Structural Analysis library includes plates, supports, loads,
	  beams, coordinate systems and trusses.
	  From Roman Putanowicz (putanowr@twins.pk.edu.pl)
	  Please see copyright information in the Structural_Analysis/readme
	  object. (Examples/Libraries/Structural_Analysis/readme.fig
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
More descriptive error message about non-existent or old app-defaults
	  file
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Removed restriction that fonts are ISO8859-1 encoded to allow, e.g.
	  iso646.1991, which is what the scalable Schumacher fonts are.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New computers/terminals in Computers library, and new network comp-
	  onents in the Networks library of objects.
	    From T. Sato (VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When a compound object containing right- or left-justified text is
	  flipped horizontally, the justification of those text objects is also
	  swapped (i.e. right-justified text becomes left-justified and vice
	  versa)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Warning printed if user uses Fig.geometry resource to size main <i>xfig</i>
	  window - should only use -geometry command-line argument or
	  pwidth/pheight args/resources.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Uses ANSI stdargs.h instead of varargs.h now.
	  From Roland Rosenfeld (roland@spinnaker.de)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Spell check command uses "%f" now instead of "%s" for filename
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Can define BINDIR to install <i>xfig</i> in custom directory (see README file)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Xfig windows aren't unmapped now when user presses "Edit Image" to
	  edit imported image file (not necessary)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When in edit mode and you hit Control-Return inside of a text box
	  rather than just Return, it's a shortcut for DONE.
	  From Jeff Hakner (hak@cooper.edu)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When editing a compound object, any text objects in it are shown and
	  editable.
	  From Jeff Hakner (hak@cooper.edu)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
In library place mode, the change draw mode function was moved to
	  Shift-Middle rather than Shift-Left.  Shift-Left now has the behavior
	  of placing the object and doing an edit on it.  When you conclude the
	  edit, it resumes place mode.  This combined with including the text
	  objects in editing compound objects, allows you to edit any text
	  labels in library objects as they are placed.
	  From Jeff Hakner (hak@cooper.edu)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Rotation angle of objects may be floating point now.
	  From Marc Joosen (marcj@historia.et.tudelft.nl)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Spelling checker and search/replace popup more useful now
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New "zoom to fit canvas" feature - Ctrl-Z accelerator in canavs will
	  zoom the figure to just fit the canvas.  New button in popup zoom
	  dialog to do same.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
After closing an open compound, the "Open Compound" mode is selected
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If the Shift key is held down while mouse button 2 is clicked on an
	  object, any comments in the object are displayed in a popup until the
	  mouse button is released
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New command-line option -flipvisualhints (resource Fig.flipvisualhints)
	  which will flip left/right mouse indicator messages for mice whose
	  buttons have been switched.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New import picture formats supported - TIFF and PPM
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Added -hiddentext and -rigidtext command-line options and X resources
	  to fill out the text flags options (first was -specialtext)
