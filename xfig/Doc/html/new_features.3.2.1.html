(Released Jul 1, 1998)

<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Preview of figure is created when you single click on a filename
	  in the popup file panel. It also shows the size of the figure.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Library feature - load a library of Fig objects and pick and place
	  objects from the library on the canvas where you want.
	  See the man pages for details, and see Examples/Libraries for some
	  examples.  From Stephane Mancini (mancini@elecsrv.enst.fr) with
	  modifications by Brian V. Smith
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Preview of library objects in library popup similar to figure preview
	  by Brian Smith
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
The library objects in the Electrical and Logic libraries were done
	  by Peter Hiscocks (phiscock@ee.ryerson.ca)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Xfig tutorial (PDF) in Doc/xfig-howto.pdf.  Also available from the
	  Help menu. Written by Peter Hiscocks (phiscock@ee.ryerson.ca)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
"make install" installs the Fig object libraries to the library
	  directory.
	  The default is $XFIGLIBDIR/Libraries (/usr/lib/X11/xfig/Libraries),
	  which may be changed in the Imakefile.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When pasting a Fig object from the <i>xfig</i> cut buffer it appears under
	  the mouse (or near the mouse if pressing the "Paste" button) where
	  it may then be moved around on the canvas before pressing mouse
	  button 1 to place it.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Unit box in upper-right corner now shows the scale (e.g. 1cm=3km)
	  This necessitated making the top ruler a little narrower to make the
	  unitbox fit.  If the mode panel is on the right side, the side ruler
	  is made wider to fit the unit box above it.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
The path of imported pictures is saved as relative path if picture is
	  in subdirectory of main figure file, else it is saved as absolute.
	  from T. Sato
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When drawing a line, moving a point on a line, or adding a point to
	  the end of a line, the angle to horizontal is shown in the message
	  window
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Pressing <Meta>-I turns on and off new feature that draws red
	  horizontal and vertical lines near the line you are drawing, or point
	  you are moving, to indicate rise and run.  Also, the length is shown
	  next to and above the horizontal and vertical line respectively, and
	  the actual length of the line is shown near the line itself.
	  The command-line argument -showlengths (resource Fig.showlengths) will
	  enable this feature as <i>xfig</i> starts.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Print popup button is active even when print panel is up which makes
	  it easy to force it to the top of the window stack if it is hidden
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Pressing the File button in the command panel while the Export panel
	  is up will popdown the export panel and popup the file panel.  The
	  converse is also true - if the Export button is pressed while the file
	  panel is up, the file panel will be popped down and the export panel
	  is popped up.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When merging a file/figure into the current figure it is made into
	  a compound object first
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Merging a figure keeps the file panel up to be able to merge more
	  figures
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Better memory allocation for temporary arrays when drawing objects -
	  may be slightly faster now
	  from T. Sato
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Freehand line/polygon drawing - use mouse button 2 to start after
	  choosing polyline.  As the mouse is moved points are added to the
	  line or polygon.
	  NOTE - this changes the line drawing behaviour:  Mouse button 3 is
	  now used to create a single-point object.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Whole window screen capture in addition to area capture in picture
	  object popup.  The behaviour of the mouse has changed with this -
	  Mouse button 1 captures whole window now and mouse button 2 is used
	  to capture area of screen.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Characters added to Fig*browse_panel*mask*string to include .tif
	  and .sld files
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If <i>xfig</i> is started without a filename, the default filename is empty
	  instead of unnamed.fig.  This forces the file panel popup when save
	  is done, to enter a new file name.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Variable time delay for popup information balloons, specified in
	  milliseconds (-balloon_delay; resource Fig.balloon_delay)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
If you enlarge the File, Export or Library panels only the file list
	  area is enlarged to show more files
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New "spinner" widgets to increment/decrement values in popup indicator
	  entries (e.g. line thickness indicator popup)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Option of using either absolute values for arrowhead sizes or multiple
	  of current line length (see arrow size popup)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Arrowhead thickness, width and height can be set explicitely in
  	  bottom panel for creating arrowheads.  Update button also copies
  	  arrowhead size info to/from objects and indicator panel.
	  The arrowhead width and height parameters are now the same units as
	  the arrowhead thickness, which is units of line thickness, not 1/1200
	  inch as they were in previous versions of <i>xfig</i>.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Color popup menu in popup edit panel handles lots of colors better
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Option of smaller icons for the mode panel (left side) by compiling
	  with USESMALLICONS in Imakefile.  See the Imakefile for details. Also
	  see Fig.ad.  Look for "icons".
	  From Andrew Morgan (morgan@physics.ucla.edu)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New grid and point positioning setting at 1/8" (or 2mm in metric mode)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When moving, copying, moving a point of or adding a point to objects,
	  all the "grab corners" of the other objects in the figure disappear
	  to make the figure less cluttered.  They reappear when the operation
	  is complete.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Pull-down menu buttons have an arrow icon to show that it is a pull-
	  down
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Units such as "i" for inches and "c" for cm may be entered following
	  coordinates in popup edit panel for editing objects (e.g. 3c for 3 cm).
	  From Rick Richardson (rick@dgii.com)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
When importing a picture file (eps, GIF, etc) <i>xfig</i> is more intelligent
	  and faster about deciding the format
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
"Integer area zoom" option in zoom popup - if checked, when using the
	  mouse to zoom an area of the canvas, the zoom amount will be an
	  integral value (e.g. 2, 3, 4)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Compose key LED may be turned on for multi-key characters (e.g.
	  a-umlaut etc) on Sun Sparcstations.  See README file about COMP_LED.
	  from Hans Werner Strube (strube@swing.physik3.gwdg.de)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
New fig2dev driver for tk (tcl/tk) - Generates tk canvas and canvas
	  objects.  From Mike Markowski (mm@udel.edu)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
Added "Alt" key definitions to the accelerators in Fig.ad to
	  accomodate those machines which don't have a Meta key
