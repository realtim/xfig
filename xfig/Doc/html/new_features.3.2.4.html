<h1><a name="newfeatures">New Features in <i>xfig 3.2.4</i></a></h1> 
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
	The xfig documentation is nearly entirely GIF-free (TM).  Only the frames images
	use GIF because they use a transparent background, which many browsers don't honor.
	PNG is used for all other images.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
	Xfig reference manual now available in PDF besides html.
	The English version is in Doc/xfig_en.pdf and the Japanese in 
	  Doc/xfig_jp.pdf.  These are also available in the Help menu.

<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
	Binary and source RPM files available for systems with rpm (RedHat
	  Package Manager).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
<img src = "images/dimension-line-newfeature.png" align=right>
Dimension lines - Hold the shift key down while drawing a polyline,
	  and after specifying the two endpoints a "dimension line" is created,
	  which is actually a compound object containing the line drawn (with
	  arrowheads if auto arrow mode is on) in the current color, "tick"
	  lines at each endpoint, text showing the length of the line in the
	  current units, and a box around the text filled in the current fill
	  color.  If this compound object is rescaled or one or more endpoints
	  are moved, the actual length is recalculated and the text is updated.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New Xfig logo courtesy of Marc-Aurele Darche.
<img src = "images/xfig-logo.png" align=top>
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Can now paste text in text mode using Shift+Middle-mouse-button in
	  addition to F20 and Sun's Paste key (F18).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> If xfig is compiled with #define WHEELMOUSE uncommented in the
	  Imakefile, the wheel may be used for several things 
	  (see <a href="miscellaneous.html#wheelmouse">Miscellaneous/Wheel Mouse</a>).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New grid/positioning option for inches mode: -grid_unit.  If the value
	  given is "1/10", "ten", "tenth", "1/10" or "10", (e.g. -grid_unit ten)
	  then the grid and point positioning is in decimal inches.  Otherwise
	  they are in 1/16 inch units (as before).  When in this mode, the grid
	  step sizes are 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 inch and the positioning steps are
	  0.05, 0.10, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 inch.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Background (-g to fig2dev) option for tk export honored now.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New command-line argument -correct_font_size (X resource
	  Fig.correct_font_size) to make xfig use real points for font sizes
	  instead of units of 1/80 inch.  xfig has always claimed that the font
	  size units are points (1/72inch), but in fact they were 1/80 inch.
	  This new option is not the default because it will break some figures
	  by making the text too large compared to other Fig objects, but it
	  will be the default in a future version.
	  The corresponding argument to fig2dev is -F (xfig automatically sets
	  this when calling fig2dev).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Added "Stop" button to stop loading library.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Much more efficient when copying large imported pictures - existing
	  pixmap is used instead of creating new one.  This also precludes the
	  need to remap colors when running out of colors when the colors are
	  identical.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When changing an attribute of an imported picture that doesn't change
	  the picture itself (e.g. depth), the pixmap is not regenerated,
	  therefore saving time.  The same is true when copying a picture.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New X resource Fig.ghostscript and command-line argument -ghostscript
	  by which you can tell xfig what your ghostscript is called (e.g. "gs"
	  or "gswin32").
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
	Can now add ASCII (EPSI) preview to EPS export. See export panel.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Can now add monochrome or color TIFF preview to EPS export.  This is
	  needed by Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, etc. to display the EPS on the
	  screen. Select from the pulldown menu of export languages.  You must
	  have fig2dev 3.2.4 for these features. See export panel.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Translations of LATEX.AND.XFIG document into two popular Chinese
	  encodings (GB2312 and Big5).  These are called LATEX.AND.XFIG.zh_CN
	  and LATEX.AND.XFIG.zh_TW respectively.
	  From Mendel Chan
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When text becomes too small to see (e.g. small zoom), xfig will
	  "Greek" it, meaning it draws a gray line segment for each word in the string.
<img src = "images/showgreeking.png" align=top>
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When resizing canvas to a smaller height, the number of buttons per
	  row of the mode (side) panel increases so that it doesn't protrude
	  into the indicator (bottom) panel
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Smarter redraw when turning on depths from the depth manager.  If
	  depth N is turned on and there are no active depths &lt; N, only depth N
	  is drawn - otherwise, the canvas is erased and the whole figure is
	  redrawn.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> If the user's pointer (mouse) buttons are switched (usually 3 2 1)
	  xfig will automatically flip the mouse hints messages. This overrides
	  the -flipvisualhints command-line argument.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> If the user clicks on or modifies an existing text, and presses
	  return, the new text on the next line will use the attributes of the
	  first text instead of the attributes from the indicator panel.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Note in README and Imakefile about not casually setting the DESTDIR
	  make variable.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Picture objects are drawn as filled gray boxes when their layer is
	  inactive in gray mode.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> xfig no longer requires fonts that are named "-adobe-..." (e.g. for
	  RedHat systems with URW fonts).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Updating the attribute panel from a compound object will retrieve
	  (only) the smallest depth from the compound.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When scaling an object, the line thickness is no longer scaled with it
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New measuring modes: angle, length and area. 
		See <a href="editing.html#measure-angle">Measure Angle/length/area</a>.  
		From Alex Durner.
		<br>
		<a href="editing.html#measure-angle"><img src="images/measure-angle-button.png"></a>
		<a href="editing.html#measure-area"><img src="images/measure-area-button.png"></a>
		<a href="editing.html#measure-length"><img src="images/measure-length-button.png"></a>
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New feature to add tangents and normal lines to curves. 
		See <a href="editing.html#add-tangent">Add Tangent</a>.  
		From Alex Durner.
		<br>
		<a href="editing.html#add-tangent"><img src="images/add-tangent-button.png"></a>

<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Splash screen on startup. Disable with -nosplash (resource Fig.splash).
	  Interior logo by  Marc-Aurèle Darche.
	<br>
	<img src = "images/splash-screen.png">
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New command-line option -grid_color (resource grid_color) to set the
	  color of the canvas grid (default: red).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New option to print grid when exporting or printing (see printing/
	  exporting section in html docs).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When drawing an arc by specifying the center point, a circle is drawn
	  showing the radius of the arc as the user drags the mouse, then when
	  the first end point is clicked an arc is drawn as the mouse is dragged.
	  The user then clicks in the direction the arc should go, followed by
	  the final angle to complete it.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> If the Ruler unit is Imperial (in), you may have xfig display
	  measurements using fractions where possible.  If a measurement can be
	  shown as an integer multiple of 64ths of an inch (or 32nds, 16ths,
	  etc.) it will show it as such (e.g. 3-5/64 in), otherwise a decimal
	  value will be shown (e.g. 3.085 in).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When opening a compound object, if the middle button us used to open
	  the compound, all other objects on the canvas are kept visible.
	  From Alex Durner.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When opening a compound object, the "point positioning" indicator is
	  enabled, allowing you to set the bounds of the compound according to
	  the indicator when you close the compound.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Zero-crossing lines on canvas have own command-line parameter
	  (-zero_lines) and resource (Fig.zero_lines) for setting color separate
	  from page border color.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Smooth factor when exporting to bitmap format is now a pull-down menu
	  with: No smoothing, Some smoothing, More smoothing.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When flipping compound objects with text, a vertical flip will now
	  shift the text to maintain its relative position to the other objects
	  in the compound and its angle is rotated by 180 degrees minus the
	  original angle.  This behavior will for example, keep the orientation
	  of a text inside a polygon consistent with the polygon.
	  A horizontal flip of a compound containing text will change the angle
	  in the same way.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Three-D borders for buttons, etc reduced from 2 to 1 pixel for "lean"
	  look (resource Fig*shadowWidth in Fig-color.ad).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Additional JPEG file format (EXIF) added for import. These usually come from
	  digital cameras.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Validation for integer spinners - doesn't allow non-numeric input when
	  typing in values directly.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When scaling an object, the scale factor is shown in the message.
	  window in addition to the width/height. From Alex Durner.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New url for pstoedit (mentioned in installation.html).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When picking points of an object at high zoom, the tolerance has been
	  reduced to make it easier to pick the correct point.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When "graying" inactive depths, the inactive objects are drawn first
	  followed by active objects ensuring visibility of active objects.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> xfig now draws "grayed out" picture objects (inactive depth) as a gray
	  box with the filename only.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Line style in edit panel now shows graphic of style instead of
	  textual description.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Cap style in edit panel was inadvertantly left off open-splines.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Popup dialog to edit behavior of spline point now pops up near the
	  point being edited.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> When cancelling drawing a picture object from the popup editor, the
	  empty object is removed rather than showing a &lt;empty&gt; in the box.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Pressing Return or Escape in popup message window will dismiss it.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> In picture browser popup, double clicking or clicking and pressing
	  Return will apply the selected picture AND close the browser.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New popup query if updating the depth in a compound object would
	  result in any depth exceeding the maximum.  The popup gives the user
	  the option to cancel the depth update part.
	  From Marcus Eger (eger.m@gmx.de)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> More consistent placement of Cancel/Ok/Set etc. buttons in dialogs.
	  Generally, the Cancel button is first followed by the others, and
	  where possible, they are at the bottom of the dialog.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> More meaningful message "Cut buffer is empty" if there is no .xfig
	  file in the user's home directory.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New MetaPost driver for TransFig 3.2.4 supported.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> New option for binary CGM export (must have TransFig 3.2.4 too). The
	  ralcgm program is required for this option.
	  See <a href="ftp://ftp.cc.rl.ac.uk/pub/graphics/ralcgm/">ftp://ftp.cc.rl.ac.uk/pub/graphics/ralcgm/</a>
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> In popup edit panel for compound objects, one may easily shift a
	  compound object by changing either corner's x, y values and pressing
	  return or scale it by changing the width and/or height and pressing
	  return.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> "condensed" alias for "narrow" fonts (urw changed their helvetica-
	   narrow to helvetica-condensed).
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Pressing escape in a popup dialog will dismiss it
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Zoom/Unzoom (Shift-Z/z) changes zoom by a factor of 1.5 instead of adding or
	  subtracting 1 from the zoom value.
	  Also, the zoom/unzoom is centered on the canvas.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> Exporting to JPEG doesn't require compiling with USE_JPEG defined in
	  Imakefile.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png"> 
	Minimum and maximum depths of objects in a compound are displayed in popup edit panel.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png">
	Rulers show units now every 10 units (e.g. 0cm, 10cm, ...)
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png">
	"Front" and "Back" labels in depth manager to show relative
	  positioning of depths on drawing.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png">
	If you wish to place a library object at the position it was
	  originally created, e.g. for laser printer labels, hold down the Shift
	  key and press mouse button 3 (`place at orign posn') to place it.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png">
	New URL for chemtool, a chemical structure editor:
	  <a href="http://ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de/~martin/chemtool/chemtool.html">
	  http://ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de/~martin/chemtool/chemtool.html</a>
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png">
	Named styles where user can save attributes that are often used for
	  quick access.  For example, the user may want dashed, thick, red lines
	  often so he can save those attributes and call it (e.g.) "thickred",
	  and easily call it up later.
	  See the <a href="main_menus.html#manage-styles">View/Manage Styles...)</a> menu entry.
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png">
	The minimum and maximum depth of objects are shown in the edit panel
	  for compound objects
<p><img src="images/blueballdot.png">
	SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) beta driver (for TransFig/fig2dev) from
	  Anthony Starks with major improvements by Martin Kroeker
	  (martin@ruby.chemie.uni-freiburg.de).  Some caveats when using
	  Mozilla-SVG to view these: 
	  <ol>
	  <li>the file must be exported with magnification = 6.6% (0.066 in fig2dev) to scale to screen coords
	  <li>the file suffix must be ".xml"
	  </ol>
